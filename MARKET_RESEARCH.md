# Market Research: Competitor Analysis (United States)

**Competitor:** Too Good To Go (TGTG)
**Website:** https://www.toogoodtogo.com/en-us
**Region:** Global (active in major US cities)

## 1. Executive Summary
Too Good To Go is the leading B2C marketplace for surplus food in the US and Europe. Their primary model connects restaurants/grocery stores with consumers who purchase "Surprise Bags" of unsold food at a steep discount (typically 1/3 of the retail price) for pickup.

## 2. Business Model Breakdown
* **The "Surprise Bag" Concept:** Businesses do not list specific items. Instead, they sell a "mystery bag" of whatever is left over. This lowers the operational effort for staff (no need to update specific inventory).
* **Revenue Stream:** Commission-based. TGTG takes a flat fee (approx. $1.79) or a percentage from every bag sold.
* **Logistics:** Zero delivery. The model relies entirely on consumer pickup to keep costs low and margins sustainable for low-value items.

## 3. SWOT Analysis of Current Market Leader

### **Strengths**
* **Simplicity for Businesses:** The "Surprise Bag" model requires almost no data entry for the restaurant.
* **Viral Marketing:** The "unboxing" aspect of mystery bags drives organic social media growth (TikTok/Instagram trends).
* **Scale:** Massive network effect with over 170,000 partner stores globally.

### **Weaknesses (Opportunities for EcoChain)**
* **Lack of Transparency:** "Surprise Bags" are a gamble. Users often complain about getting items they dislike or cannot eat (e.g., just plain rice or bread).
* **Dietary Restrictions:** It is difficult for users with allergies (gluten, nuts, dairy) to use the platform safely due to the mystery element.
* **Pickup Only:** Limits the user base to those with transport or within walking distance.

## 4. Strategic Differentiation for EcoChain
Based on this research, EcoChain can differentiate itself by solving the "Mystery Bag" friction points:

1.  **Transparency vs. Mystery:** Unlike TGTG, **EcoChain** could allow businesses to list broad categories (e.g., "Dairy Bundle" vs "Bakery Bundle") or specific high-value items to build trust.
2.  **Smart Filtering:** Implement strict dietary filtering (Gluten-Free, Vegan, Halal) as a core search feature, which TGTG lacks.
3.  **Community Focus:** While TGTG is transactional, **EcoChain** can focus on the community aspect—allowing donations to local shelters rather than just sales, closing the loop on the "Waste-to-Value" promise.

## 5. Conclusion
While Too Good To Go dominates the general "food rescue" market with a volume-based mystery model, there is a significant gap in the market for a more transparent, dietary-conscious solution that better serves specific user needs.
